# hopfield
Hopfield networks.


## Motivation

We are seeking a process with two steps:

1. input data are encoded into binary codes via some trained encoder;
1. and then the codes are taken into a Hopfield network, s.t. each binary code relaxes, after several steps basing on the updating rule, into its "standard" pattern,

such that intrinsically similar, e.g. in some task, data are relaxed into the same "standard" pattern. That is, they are encoded into the same field of attraction of some pattern.

The first step is called "perception" (in sensors) and the second "associative memory" (within brain). Combination of them is the perceptive process of human, as well as, as it should be, of machine.
